BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE-AUDIT:
======================================

dcm4chee-audit includes

- dcm4che-audit-logger : JMX Service for emitting DICOM Supp95 Audit Trail
  Messages, and
- dcm4che-audit-login : JAAS login module emitting User Authentication message

Both are used by the dcm4chee archive application (dcm4chee), as well by the
dcm4chee Audit Record Repository (dcm4chee-arr).

Beside JDK 5 or JDK 6 - which is also needed for running the archive
application or the Audit Record Repository - you also have to download and
install Maven 2.0.7 from http://maven.apache.org/download.html for building
dcm4che-audit-logger and dcm4che-audit-login.

If you are behind a http proxy, you have to configure Maven, to use it for
http downloads (s.  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html ).

After that,

$ cd dcm4chee-audit-2.14.3
$ mvn install

will download necessary artifacts from public Maven Repositories by http,
build dcm4chee-audit-logger-2.13.0.jar and dcm4chee-audit-login-2.13.0.jar,
and install them in your local Maven Repository (default: ~/-m2/repository),
for usage by the build tasks for the dcm4chee archive application or the
Audit Record Repository.
