install.bat or install.sh script, as appropriate for your operating
system, with the path of your DCM4CHEE installation directory as parameter.

Due to issue WEB-933 it may be possible that folder and trash contains instances which 
are referencing one and the same file. This may result in data loss if such an instance 
get's deleted from trash.
To find and correct such situations you have to deploy and run the cleanup service.

   <DCM4CHEE>/server/default/deploy
2. Start DMC4CHEE archive
3. Open jmx-console (http://localhost:8080/jmx-console)
4. Open dcm4chee.update service=CleanupDuplicatedFilesService
5. (Optional) Get an overview about duplicated file references with following commands:
   a) countDuplicates(): Show number of duplicated file references in folder (ONLINE_STORAGE) 
   b) showDuplicates() : List duplicated files with info about Patient/Study/Series and Instance 
   c) countDuplicatedTrashFiles(): Show number of files in trash which are also referenced in folder 
   d) showDuplicatedTrashFiles() : List files in trash with Patient/Study/Series and Instance info
6. Correct duplicated file references by invoking cleanup():
   Performed corrections:
   a) Duplicates in folder are copied to a new file
   b) Duplicates in trash are removed from trash
   Info about duplicated file references are documented in <DCM4CHEE>/server/default/log/cleanup.log
   This informations can be use to manually correct your data (delete wrong instances)

After cleanup the service can be removed by deleting dcm4chee-cleanup-ear-3.0.3-<db>.ear from deploy directory
