Security configuration:
-----------------------

The dcm4chee-web3 application supports the single sign on (SSO) implementation of the jboss web container.

For activation, please do the following:

    1) In the web.xml of the war module a web security method has to be declared:

	i.e. FORM BASED:

	    <login-config>
		<auth-method>FORM</auth-method>
		<realm-name>dcm4chee</realm-name>
		<form-login-config>
		    <form-login-page>/login.jsp</form-login-page>
		    <form-error-page>/login.jsp</form-error-page>
		</form-login-config>
	    </login-config>
    
	or BASIC AUTH:

	    <login-config>
		<auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
		<realm-name>dcm4chee</realm-name>
	    </login-config>

	FORM BASED authentication is used as a default.


    2) In the server.xml of your jboss installation
	(which defaults to server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/)
	enter:

	<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn" requireReauthentication="true" />


If there is no web security method declared in the web.xml of the war module, 
the integrated security of the dcm4chee-web3 application is used and does the authentication.
Note that in this case, even if you have entered the SSO valve in the server.xml, the SSO will not work.
