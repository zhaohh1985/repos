WEBVIEWER support in DCM4CHEE WEB3
========================================================
The folder support the use of WebViewer by providing a URLProvider Interface (SPI)
This interface must be implemented for a particular WebViewer to get the
URL's to open the viewer for patient, study, series,..
The dcm4chee-web project contains already two implementations:
OVIYAM and WEASIS (see http://www.dcm4che.org/confluence/display/WEA/Installing+Weasis+in+DCM4CHEE) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che/files/)

Example: OVIYAM Viewer 

Build UrlProvider implementation for OVIYAM:
$ cd dcm4chee-oviyam
$ mvn install

Install UrlProvider:
Stop DCM4CHEE archive

copy dcm4chee-web-oviyam-3.0.1.jar <DCM4CHEE>/server/default/lib

Note: the WebViewer itself must also be installed:
Download OVIYAM binary distribution and copy the war file (found in zip)
to <DCM4CHEE>/server/default/deploy

Start DCM4CHEE archive

Configuration:
In jmx-console (http://localhost:8080/jmx-console) go to dcm4chee.web service=WebConfig.
There you find 'InstalledWebViewer' Attribute which should show 'oviyam'.
To activate the WebViewer you have to set attribute 'WebviewerNames' to oviyam (or ANY).
