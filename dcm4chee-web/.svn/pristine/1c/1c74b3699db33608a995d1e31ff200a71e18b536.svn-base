BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE WEB3:
========================================================

Beside JDK 5 or JDK 6 - which is also needed for running DCM4CHEE
you also have to download and install Maven 2.2.1 from
http://maven.apache.org/download.html for building dcm4chee-web-3.0.0.

If you are behind a http proxy, you have to configure Maven, to use it for
http downloads (s.  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html ).

The complete dcm4chee-web3 source package consists of 6 modules bundled in a 
single source package.

Download and unzip the source package in a working directory.

$ cd <work directory>/dcm4chee-web
$ mvn -Pall -Ddb=<database> install

(will download necessary artifacts from public Maven Repositories by http,
before building MBean and WEB components and install them in your 
local repository (default: ~/.m2/repository))

Finally
$ cd dcm4chee-web-dist
$ mvn -Ddb=<database> assembly:assembly

will assembly the binary distribution package in a zip file.

Supported <database> arguments:
  db2, firebird, hsql, mssql, mysql, oracle, psql

Example:
$ cd ~/work/dcm4chee-web
$ mvn -Pall -Ddb=mysql install
$ cd dcm4chee-web-dist
$ mvn -Ddb=mysql assembly:assembly

---------------------------------------------------------------------

You may build the six modules individually.
In this case the modules have to be built in a specific order, 
from first to last:

  dcm4chee-icons
  dcm4chee-arc3-entities
  dcm4chee-web-common
  dcm4chee-dashboard
  dcm4chee-usr
  dcm4chee-web

Maven build:
$ cd <module>
$ mvn -Ddb=<database> install


Example:
$ cd ~/work/dcm4chee-icons
$ mvn -Ddb=mysql install

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Standalone modules:
Additional, there are standalone modules for the UserManagement and the Dashboard functionality, 
found in the dcm4chee-usr/dcm4chee-usr-ear/target and dcm4chee-dashboard/dcm4chee-dashboard-ear/target 
after building.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Building the source distribution package:
$ cd ~/work/dcm4chee-web/dcm4chee-web-dist
$ mvn -Psrc assembly:assembly
