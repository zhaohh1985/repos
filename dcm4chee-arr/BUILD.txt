BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR DCM4CHEE AUDIT RECORD REPOSITORY:
========================================================

Beside JDK 5 or JDK 6 - which is also needed for running the Audit Record
Repository - you also have to download and install Maven 2.2.1 from
http://maven.apache.org/download.html for building the Audit Record Repository.

If you are behind a http proxy, you have to configure Maven, to use it for
http downloads (s.  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html ).

The dcm4chee Audit Record Repostory (dcm4chee-arr) uses

- dcm4che-audit-logger : JMX Service for emitting DICOM Supp95 Audit Trail
  Messages, and
- dcm4che-audit-login : JAAS login module emitting User Authentication message

which sources are not included by dcm4chee-arr, but provided as separate
package dcm4chee-audit at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che . Follow
the build instructions included in dcm4chee-audit, to build and install these
artefacts in your local Maven Repository (default: ~/.m2/repository) for usage
by following build task for the Audit Record Repository.

After that,

$ cd dcm4chee-arr-3.0.10
$ mvn -Ddb=<database>  install

with

<database> ::= db2|hsql|mssql|mysql|oracle|psql

will download necessary artifacts from public Maven Repositories by http,
before building EJB and WEB components of the Audit Record Repository for the
specified data base and pack them into an EAR archive, including necessary
third-party libraries.

Finally,

$ cd dcm4chee-arr-dist
$ mvn -Ddb=<database> assembly:assembly

will assembly the binary distribution package dcm4chee-arr-3.0.10-<db>.zip,
including the EAR archive built before, but also dcm4che-audit-logger,
dcm4che-audit-login and JBoss configuration files.
